# GROMACs_Custom-ForceField
A tutorial showing how to edit GROMACs force field files for a custom, non-standard protein.

GROMACs package is an incredibly useful tool for running molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, however, I have found that running MD for a system with complex cofactors requires significant editting of force field (FF) files and no online resource offers a thorough description of exactly which files must be editted. This is a problem for me, as my work requires just that. In this guide, I will walk through everything needed to simulate photosystem 1 using the GROMACs software. Other software used in this guide include Qchem, and CHARMM-GUI. The challenge of fitting photosystem 1 into GROMACs is that several cofactors are not defined in the standard FFs. Of these cofactors, the iron-sulfur clusters (SF4, contains 4 Fe and 4 S) are the trickiest. SF4 requires more work, and will be discussed first. If you are only interested in adding organic cofactors that do not contain troublesome metals, you may want to skip to the 'Organic Cofactors' section below.
